# The vulnerability of Australian rural communities to climate variability and change

Revamped AC maps from '00s to map holistic measures of adaptive capacity across Australia -  imperfectly examining vulnerability through the lens of an impact/hazard modelling approach to risk management

The process is described in two papers:
- [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2009.09.006](Part I—Conceptualising and measuring vulnerability),
- [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2009.09.007](Part II—Integrating impacts with adaptive capacity).
